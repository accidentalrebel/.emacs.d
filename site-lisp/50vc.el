;; The above will mirror all directories at the given backup dir. For example, if you are editing a file
;; "/Users/jane/web/xyz/myfile.txt", and your backup root is "/Users/jane/.emacs.d/emacs-backup", then the backup will
;; be at "/Users/jane/.emacs.d/emacs-backup/Users/jane/web/xyz/myfile.txt~".

;; If you want all backup to be flat in a dir, use the following:

;; (setq backup-directory-alist '(("" . "~/.emacs.d/emacs-backup")))

;; This will create backup files flat in the given dir, and the backup file names will have "!" characters in place of
;; the directory separator. For example, if you are editing a file at "/Users/jane/web/xyz/myfile.txt", and your backup
;; dir is set at "/Users/jane/.emacs.d/emacs-backup", then the backup file will be at:
;; "/Users/jane/.emacs.d/emacs-backup/Users!jane!web!emacs!myfile.txt~". If you use long file names or many nested dirs,
;; this scheme will reach file name length limit quickly.
