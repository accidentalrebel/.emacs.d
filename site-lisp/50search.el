;; What if you want to replace a found match but then edit that particular match slightly differenty before continuing

;; if there are several variations?)

;; In this case when prompted for a replacement, type control-r for a "recusrive edit". Now you are in a position to
;; edit that specific replacement before continuing with the search for the next match. If you want to do the replace
;; and then review the replaced text before continuing with the next match, do this: type comma "," to do the replace
;; but remain at that spot. You can type control-r to recursively edit the replaced text or do the usual to continue on.

;; control-meta-c escapes the recursive edit and continues with the search.

;; What if you made a mistake with the previous match? Either you should have made the replacement and didn't, or you
;; should not have made the replacement. Type "^" and query replace takes you back to the location of the previous match
;; with the text in the state as you left it.
