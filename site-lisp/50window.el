;;; recursive-edit
;; Hitting C-c r e will put you in a "recursive editing mode", that is simply an embedded call to the editing loop. The
;; point here is that you can exit this inner loop, which means that you return from the recursive-edit function. This
;; way, the recursive editing can be guarded by some context-saving macros : here save-window-excursion and
;; save-excursion. Once the user quits the recursive edit, the context is restored, which means here that the windows
;; state, current buffer and position are restored : you're back in the state where your brain was preempted without
;; even needing to remember it.

;; Enter a recursive edit. C-M-c will bring back exactly there
;; `C-M-c' default binding to exit-recursive-edit, it means returning to the
;; unfinished command, which continues execution
;; `C-]'   default binding to abort-recursive-edit, This is like exiting, but
;; also quits the unfinished command immediately.

;; RecursiveEditPreservingWindowConfig

(defmacro recursive-edit-preserving-window-config (body)
  "*Return a command that enters a recursive edit after executing BODY.
 Upon exiting the recursive edit (with \\[exit-recursive-edit] (exit)
 or \\[abort-recursive-edit] (abort)), restore window configuration
 in current frame."
  `(lambda ()
     "See the documentation for `recursive-edit-preserving-window-config'."
     (interactive)
     (save-window-excursion
       ,body
       (recursive-edit))))

;; Use it like this:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c 0") (recursive-edit-preserving-window-config (delete-window)))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c 2") (recursive-edit-preserving-window-config

;; Now pressing "C-c 1" will delete all other windows in the current frame and put
;; you into "recursive editing". You know you are in a recursive edit by noting the
;; square brackets around the parentheses that always surround the major and minor
;; mode names. After exiting recursive edit, e.g. by using "C-M-c"
;; ('exit-recursive-edit'), the original window configuration is restored.
