;;; Commentary:

;; When typing operators, this package can automatically insert spaces
;; before and after operators. For instance, `=' will become ` = ', `+='
;; will become ` += '. This is handy for writing C-style sources.

;; To use, put this file to your load-path and the following to your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;             (require 'smarter-operator)
;;
;; Then `M-x smarter-operator-mode' for toggling this minor mode.

;; Usage Tips
;; ----------

;; - If you want it to insert operator with surrounding spaces , you'd
;;   better not type the front space yourself, instead, type operator
;;   directly. smarter-operator-mode will also take this as a hint on how
;;   to properly insert spaces in some specific occasions. For
;;   example, in c-mode, `a*' -> `a * ', `char *' -> `char *'.

;;; Acknowledgements

;; Nikolaj Schumacher <n_schumacher@web.de>, for suggesting
;; reimplementing as a minor mode and providing an initial patch for
;; that.

;;; TODO:

;; - for c mode, probably it would be much better doing this in cc-mode.

;;; Code:

;;; smarter-operator minor mode
