;; qurey-replace, use C-r to

;; What if you want to replace a found match but then edit that particular match slightly differenty before continuing
;; on? (Otherwise you have to remember to go back, and where to go back to, to edit that specific replacement. And what
;; if there are several variations?)

;; In this case when prompted for a replacement, type control-r for a "recusrive edit". Now you are in a position to
;; edit that specific replacement before continuing with the search for the next match. If you want to do the replace
;; and then review the replaced text before continuing with the next match, do this: type comma "," to do the replace
;; but remain at that spot. You can type control-r to recursively edit the replaced text or do the usual to continue on.

;; control-meta-c escapes the recursive edit and continues with the search.

;; What if you made a mistake with the previous match? Either you should have made the replacement and didn't, or you
;; should not have made the replacement. Type "^" and query replace takes you back to the location of the previous match
;; with the text in the state as you left it.

;; help
;; Type Space or `y' to replace one match, Delete or `n' to skip to next,
;; RET or `q' to exit, Period to replace one match and exit,
;; Comma to replace but not move point immediately,
;; C-r to enter recursive edit (C-M-c to get out again),
;; C-w to delete match and recursive edit,
;; C-l to clear the screen, redisplay, and offer same replacement again,
;; ! to replace all remaining matches with no more questions,
;; ^ to move point back to previous match,
